<h1>Cricut Design Space: What is a SVG file - Thecreativen</h1>

<div class="container">

<p>It can be overwhelming when you first buy your Cricut machine.&nbsp;It&#39;s almost as if you are learning a new language.&nbsp;There are many tools and terms to be familiarized with, not only is there so much to learn but so many terms as well.&nbsp;Today, <a href="https://thecreativen.com/">The Creativen</a>&nbsp;wanted to share a very important and popular concept that all Cricut users need to know: SVG files (also called cut files in Cricut).&nbsp;You may be wondering, &quot;Huh?&quot;&nbsp;SVG files?&quot; Don&#39;t worry, we got you!&nbsp;Let&#39;s continue to learn.</p>

<h2>What is SVG?</h2>

<p>SVG stands to Scalable Vector Graphic. This is a fancy term that means that a vector graphic can be scaled to any size without losing its sharpness.&nbsp;Did you ever try to print a photo only to discover that the bigger the file, the blurrier it became?&nbsp;SVG files are able to avoid this problem.&nbsp;A file measuring 0.5 inches could be enlarged to 50 feet. It would not get blurry or lose its resolution.&nbsp;You can download an SVG file online, and upload it to Design Space without worrying about its quality.&nbsp;SVG files are also editable.&nbsp;This basically means that you can import an SVG file into Design Space and edit it as you wish.&nbsp;You can modify the SVG at your leisure when you upload it. You can also choose to print, cut, or split the SVG if you want one section to be cut on one material.&nbsp;Let&#39;s take, for example, an SVG that shows an apple with the word &quot;teacher&quot; written on it.&nbsp;You can modify the SVG to make the apple cut on vinyl, and then tell Design Space to cut the &quot;teacher&rdquo; part on chipboard.&nbsp;You can customize everything!&nbsp;SVGs can be uploaded to Cricut. They are crisp, clear, and simple to use.&nbsp;SVGs are often called Cut Files in Cricut/Silhouette.</p>

<h2>Where can I find SVG files</h2>

<p>SVG files can be found on Pinterest for free. However, there are many places where you can purchase SVG files for a small fee.&nbsp;You can search Etsy for the exact item you are looking to purchase if you know what you want.&nbsp;You can search for an Easter bunny SVG on Etsy by typing &quot;Easter Bunny SVG&quot; and you will find thousands of other SVG&#39;s.&nbsp;They will cost you a small amount, but you get a professional design for a fraction of the price.&nbsp;Creative Market, Hungry JPEG and Design Bundles are all websites that offer SVG files.&nbsp;There are likely to be Facebook groups that you can join, I&#39;m sure!</p>

<h2>How do I upload SVG files?</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Go to www.cricut.com/design and log-in</li>
    <li>Click on New Project.</li>
    <li>Click on Upload to the left side of the page.</li>
    <li>Click on &quot;Image Upload&quot; to upload your file.</li>
    <li>Next, you will see a screen that allows you to preview your image and assign the file a name.&nbsp;Once you are done, click Save in bottom right corner.</li>
    <li>Next, you will see a screen that displays all your uploaded images.&nbsp;This is the screen we saw in step 3.&nbsp;Click on the image you want to insert and in the bottom right corner click the green button.</li>
    <li>We are now on the canvas in Design Space.&nbsp;SVG&#39;s are customizable and can be modified, so they don&#39;t have to be grouped together.&nbsp;You can make modifications to the SVG here.&nbsp;If you prefer the SVG as it is, you can do so here. Or, you can buy SVG at&nbsp;<a href="https://thecreativen.com/">https://thecreativen.com/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s IT!&nbsp;SVG files, as I mentioned earlier, sound complicated - and they certainly are technical. But in the end, they are great files that can be uploaded to Design Space.&nbsp;These files are similar to cartridges that you had to manually upload but they can now be accessed online.&nbsp;They can be edited, and they are crisp and clear.&nbsp;It will be a joy to use.</p>
